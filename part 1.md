# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Pipeline Implementation

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that enhances language models by integrating external knowledge retrieval with generative capabilities. This document provides a step-by-step guide to implementing a RAG pipeline using LangChain.

---

## **Pipeline Overview**

1. **Data Injection**: Load documents or data sources (e.g., text files, PDFs).
2. **Data Transformation**: Split the documents into manageable chunks.
3. **Embedding**: Convert text chunks into vector representations.
4. **Vector Storage**: Store vectors in a database for efficient querying.
5. **Querying**: Retrieve relevant results based on a query.

---

## **Implementation Steps**

### Step 1: Loading Data (Data Injection)

#### Loading PDFs
```python
from langchain.document_loaders import PyPDFLoader

loader = PyPDFLoader("attention.pdf")
documents = loader.load()
```
- Install the required library:
  ```
  pip install pypdf
  ```

#### Loading Other Formats
LangChain supports various formats such as text files, Excel, and directories.

---

### Step 2: Transforming Data (Text Splitting)

Split large documents into smaller chunks for efficient processing.

#### Using Recursive Character Text Splitter
```python
from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter

text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(
    chunk_size=1000,  # Maximum size of a chunk
    chunk_overlap=200 # Overlap between chunks for context preservation
)
split_documents = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)
```

---

### Step 3: Embedding Text

Convert text chunks into vector representations using embeddings.

#### Using OpenAI Embeddings
```python
from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings

openai_embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()
```

Alternative: Use Hugging Face embeddings if OpenAI is unavailable.

---

### Step 4: Storing Data (Vector Store)

Store vectorized data for efficient querying.

#### Using Chroma Database
```python
from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma

db = Chroma.from_documents(
    split_documents[:20],  # Use a subset of documents for faster processing
    embedding=openai_embeddings
)
```
- Install the required library:
  ```
  pip install chromadb
  ```

#### Using FAISS Database
```python
from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS

db1 = FAISS.from_documents(
    split_documents[:20],
    embedding=openai_embeddings
)
```

---

### Step 5: Querying the Vector Database

Retrieve relevant results by querying the vector database.

#### Example Query
```python
query = "Who are the authors of the 'Attention is All You Need' paper?"
result = db.similarity_search(query)
print(result[0]['page_content'])
```

### Additional Example Queries
- "What is attention?"
- "Who are the authors of the paper?"

## **Key Concepts**

1. **Text Splitting**: Dividing large documents into smaller chunks for efficient embedding.
2. **Embeddings**: Numerical vector representations of text created using OpenAI or Hugging Face models.
3. **Vector Database**:
   - **ChromaDB**: A modern vector database for local storage.
   - **FAISS**: A library for fast vector similarity searches.
4. **Querying**: Retrieving the most relevant results using similarity search.

---

## **Future Enhancements**

1. **Cloud Support**: Store vector databases in the cloud for scalability.
2. **Retrievers and Chains**: Enhance querying by using LangChain retrievers and chains.
3. **Advanced Use Cases**:
   - Summarization of retrieved documents.
   - Contextual generation based on specific queries.

---

## **Summary**

This RAG pipeline demonstrates how to:

1. Load data from various sources (e.g., PDFs).
2. Split data into manageable chunks.
3. Generate embeddings using OpenAI models.
4. Store embeddings in vector databases like Chroma or FAISS.
5. Query the database to retrieve relevant information.

This approach is ideal for building intelligent applications such as **chatbots**, **knowledge bases**, and **intelligent assistants** where retrieval and generation are combined to enhance user experience.
